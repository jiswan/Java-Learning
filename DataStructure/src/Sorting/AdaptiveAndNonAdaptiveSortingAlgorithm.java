 * A sorting algorithm is said to be adaptive, if it takes advantage of already

 * the source list has some element already sorted, adaptive algorithms will
 * take this into account and will try not to re-order them.
 * 
 * A non-adaptive algorithm is one which does not take into account the elements
 * which are already sorted. They try to force every single element to be
 * re-ordered to confirm their sortedness.
